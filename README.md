👋 Hi, I'm Federico from Argentina 🇦🇷, currently based in Hamburg, DE 🇩🇪. Before this, I called Wageningen, NL 🇳🇱 home, and who knows where the next adventure will take me! 🌍. 

❤️ I'm deeply passionate about open source and spend my coding hours on Python projects, automation, and data-related stuff.

🚀 One of my key projects is [cookiecutter-modern-pypackage](https://github.com/fedejaure/cookiecutter-modern-pypackage), aimed at simplifying the creation of modern Python packages.

🙏 Join me on this journey, and let's contribute to the open source community together.
